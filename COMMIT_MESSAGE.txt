Optimize database import and implement SQL-based filtering for complex queries

This commit significantly improves the proxy's performance and functionality:

1. **Smart Import Check** - Skip re-importing 3GB SQLite database on restart
   - Added `check_if_import_needed()` function that checks if main tables
     (cv_issue, cv_volume, cv_person, cv_publisher) already have data
   - If data exists, import is skipped, dramatically reducing startup time
   - Only imports when database is actually empty

2. **SQL-Based Filtering for Complex Queries** - Handle filters and sorting in database
   - Rewrote `get_list_from_db()` to parse ComicVine filter syntax and convert
     to SQL queries using PostgreSQL JSONB operators
   - Supports filters: `filter=name:Iron Man` → `WHERE data->>'name' = 'Iron Man'`
   - Supports sorting: `sort=start_year:desc` → `ORDER BY data->>'start_year' DESC`
   - Supports multiple filters: `filter=name:Iron Man,start_year:1963`
   - Handles pagination with `limit` and `offset` parameters
   - List endpoints now always check database first (even with complex filters)
     before falling back to ComicVine API

3. **Simplified Resource Type Mapping** - Only support actual database tables
   - Updated all table maps to only include the 4 tables that exist:
     * issue → cv_issue
     * volume → cv_volume
     * person → cv_person
     * publisher → cv_publisher
   - Removed references to non-existent resource types (character, concept,
     object, origin, power, story_arc, team, location, series, episode, etc.)
   - Requests for unsupported resource types are forwarded directly to API

4. **Enhanced Import Handling**
   - Added explicit import handlers for cv_person and cv_publisher tables
   - Improved table skipping logic:
     * Skips FTS tables (volume_fts, volume_fts_data, volume_fts_idx, etc.)
     * Skips sqlite_stat1 (SQLite statistics table)
   - Other tables (cv_sync_metadata, comic_files, comic_covers) are imported
     generically but not used for API proxying

5. **Better Logging and Error Handling**
   - Added detailed [SOURCE] logging to track data source (database vs API)
   - Improved error messages for database connection issues
   - Better handling of missing tables and connection failures

Technical Details:
- Uses PostgreSQL JSONB operators (data->>'field') for filtering and sorting
- Maintains ComicVine API response format for compatibility
- Handles edge cases (missing tables, empty results, connection failures)
- All database queries use parameterized statements for security

Performance Improvements:
- Startup time reduced from minutes to seconds when data exists
- Complex filtered queries now served from database instead of API
- Reduced API rate limiting issues by serving more requests from cache

This change makes the proxy much more efficient and practical for production use,
especially with large databases that would otherwise take a long time to import
on every restart.
